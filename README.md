# Aeterna Conflictus
Aeterna Conflictus means Eternal Conflict.
- Welcome to Aeterna Conflictus github repository where you can download through releases because I don't like using Google Drive, and make feedbacks and critics. (Please guide us, this is our first time making and publishing mod)

- This mod aims to be "original" (*cough* heavy inspiration *cough*) by using unique and simple artstyle with original soundtrack.

Note: This mod is heavily inspired by other games, mythologies, etc. OST included.
